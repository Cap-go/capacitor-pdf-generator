# Example App for `@capgo/capacitor-pdf-generator`

This Vite project links directly to the local plugin source so you can exercise the native APIs while developing.

## Actions in this playground

- **Generate from HTML (base64)** – Renders inline HTML and returns a base64 string.
- **Generate from HTML (share)** – Generates a PDF and opens the native share dialog.
- **Generate from URL** – Loads a remote page and returns the PDF as base64.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Add native shells with `npx cap add ios` or `npx cap add android` from this folder to try behaviour on device or simulator.
